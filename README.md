CodeSilhouette
==============

[Use it here](http://chainsawpolice.github.io/codesilhouette/)

I decided to teach myself JavaScript this morning and this is what I came up with, a simple code silhouette generator built in under a day.

Even though it was a one-day project, pull requests and changes are totally welcome like always. I'm eager to learn by my mistakes.
